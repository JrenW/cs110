    "## Task Scheduler for a Multi-Tasking Minervan in a Rotation City - Part I \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Overview\n",
    "This assignment is Part I of a two-part location-based assignment. In this part, you are required to apply the concept of priority queues discussed in class while planning and scheduling activities and tasks in your current rotation city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task scheduler receives a list of tasks to be performed in a given amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    " -  Some tasks can be performed simultaneously, as in multitasking (e.g. sipping a local beverage while chatting with a friend at a cafe),\n",
    " -  While other tasks require your full attention (e.g. CS110 pre-class work).\n",
    " -  In addition, some tasks have dependencies (e.g. you can’t drink a local beverage at a local\n",
    " cafe if you have not yet reached the cafe).\n",
    " \n",
    "Your scheduler must output a step-by-step execution of the input tasks and a report on the total amount of time required to execute all the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the tasks\n",
    "● Every task in the input list has the following data fields:\n",
    "![data_fields](Task_columns.png)\n",
    "* **Task ID**: Unique task identifier which other tasks may reference (to deal with task dependencies).\n",
    "* **Task Description**: A short description of the task (e.g. ‘visit the Neues Museum’, ‘Dine gogigui’, ‘get a Fahrkarten’, ‘go to an exhibition at the Dongdaemun Design Plaza”, etc)\n",
    "* **Task Duration in minutes**: Duration of the task in minutes.\n",
    "* **Multitasking**: A *boolean* field that indicates whether or not the task allows for multitasking tasks.\n",
    "* **Dependencies**: This is a list of Task IDs indicating whether the current task cannot begin until all of its dependencies have been completed (e.g. one cannot eat gogigui unless one has already found a restaurant in Seoul, has arrived at a restaurant, has gotten a table, has ordered, etc.)\n",
    "* **Status**: a task has one of these states: NOT-YET-STARTED, IN-PROGRESS, or COMPLETED.\n"

    "### Your Task:\n",
    "With an input list of tasks as described above, your scheduler needs to build a MAXHEAP priority queue (or a MINHEAP depending on your implementation) to plan the execution of the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Criteria for scheduling tasks\n",
    "All tasks at the beginning should have a very low priority. Your scheduler will begin scheduling tasks by first looking at which tasks are ready to be executed and assign them a higher priority than the ones that have dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to consider different criteria for deciding which task is tackled first among tasks that are ready to be executed (e.g., you may choose to consider first a task that has a large number of dependencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Criteria for scheduling Non-Multitasking tasks\n",
    "These tasks require your full attention, therefore your scheduler cannot schedule any other tasks while a non-multitasking task has not been completed. After completion of a non-multitasking task, make sure to update the dependencies of any other tasks (where appropriate) and the corresponding priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Criteria for scheduling Multitasking tasks\n",
    "These tasks can share your time. You can design your scheduler to have a parameterized way to subdivide the time that you dedicate to multitasking tasks. For instance, a multitasking time that takes 10 minutes, can be tackled in five chunks of 2 mins or a minute at a time, hence allowing you to share your attention with other tasks in your list that have the same priority. Every time you partially execute a multitask, you have to update its “Task Duration in minutes”--when this time is 0, the task is to be set as completed."

Please consult the rubrics for the LOs mentioned in each part of the assignment to optimally align your approach to the rubrics."

    "1. There are two types of tasks: global vs local tasks.\n",
    "2. A local task belongs to one specific activity (e.g. task 'buy museum ticket' in activity 'visit de Young Museum'); \n",
    "3. a global task is strictly multitasking, and can be assigned across activities (e.g. 'take photos' has a total duration of 60min, and can be assigned across all five sight-seeing activities in multiples of 5-min chunks.)\n",
    "4. Acitivities follow in strict seqence: No local tasks from activity 2 can be executed before all local tasks from activity 1 have been completed.\n",
    "5. One activity has a total duration that is larger than the sum of all local tasks of that activity, so the remaining time could be allocated to global multitasking tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "    (e.g. the activity'visit de Young Museum' takes 2 hours (120min) in total, however the sum of all 4 tasks (buy ticket, walk along art gallery, take notes, verbal critique with friends) only take 100min, the remaining 20mins could be partitioning into 2 times of 'take photos' + 3 times of 'listen to musics from iphone playlist'. \n",

    "- The scheduler will check across currently non-'COMPLETED' tasks, spot a task that is 'ready' (0 dependencies at current time stamp), calculate its priority queue score (according to some priority rules I made to reflect common sense of trip scheduling) and push it back into the priority queue;\n",

    "        e.g1. a local non-multitasking task, JPT4 that has 0 dependencies would be given a high pq score, and once pushed in would surface at the top, so new pq = [JPT4,GLB1,GLB2,GLB3,GLB4], a non-multitasking task must be executed once pushed in; \n",
    "        e.g2. two local multitasking task, GGB3 and GGB4, come in with higher priority scores so current pq = [GGB3,GGB4,GLB1,GLB2,GLB3,GLB4]\n",
    "- after we prepare the 30-min pq, the scheduler will 'execute' them in order of priority: 1st non-multitasking tasks; 2nd iterate between local multitasking tasks (e.g. GGB3 for 5min, GGB4 for 5min, GGB3 for 5min etc)\n",
    "- once a task is 'COMPLETED' it is popped out of priority queue.\n",

    "- priority queue is a superior data structure than simple array in a scheduler as it only cares about keeping the maxheap structure and make sure to return the largest value in queue (a scheduler is only interested in what's next) , whereas a loop would also take care of their ordering (i.e. the last item you append will always stay in the last slot); \n",
    "- by giving different task with a priority score, we can implement partitioning among multitasks without re-sorting items in a list every time a task is executed, instead, we simply push back a still IN_PROCESS multitask into the current pq, and it will automatically surface to its designated priority level (by maintaining the max heap structure;\n",
    "- the scheduler results I got was quite human-like, with frequent attention shifts and juggling along 2-3 tasks at the same time (if they are all currently ready), some evidence:\n",
    "![human like behavior](deYoung_excerpt.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- it is also surprising to see that, by implementing the pq structure itself results in some 'randomization' as compared to a sorted list due to its binary tree structure (e.g. on branch of high priority tasks, another branch of low priority tasks, the list won't appear sorted and same-level priority tasks may be executed in different order;\n",

    "- due to the dynamic feature and the unique way a priority queue is heapified, my priority score heuristics does not work every time. in my 20 tests of running run_Scheduler(  ), 2 times I get very weired behavior such as 'eat Japanese sesami mochi' for the next three 30mins window, but most of time, it returns a schedule that makes much human sense;\n"

I also consulted TA for clarification of problem prompts for 'best partitioning'and figured out how to critique a strategy's efficiency by assessing its time wasted for a given chunck of time. Both consultations helped me a lot in defining the right problem features, the assumptions ('multitasking'), obstacles(partition via pq)and constraints(e.g. no advanced python libraries)\n",

    "**#evidencebased**: in section C, I created a dummy dataset and explicitly showed a scheduler's behavior in printout format, and comment based on them; in section E, I also attached screenshots of scheduler's behavior to back up my argument for choosing pq over sorted list for a more 'human' task scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**#distribution**: I explained why Gaussian is a better probability assumption than uniform distribution for each sub chunk of a multitasking task and also provide reasons for using the uniform in light of assignment constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**#heuristics**: since I define my goal state to produce a scheduler that mimics human behavior (which is quite challenging) given limited information (e.g. why and to what extent does task A deserve a higher priority than task B) and tools (no advanced libraries) I successfully applied some rules of thumb to determine tasks priority scores and their subsequent diminish in supriority after a sub_chunk is executed."
