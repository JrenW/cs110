    "\n",
    "*As a CS student, how could you find a smarter way to soothe your mom's worriness about forgetting an important personal item in her giant tote bag?* \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2. Common data structures \n",
    "So far we have been quite satisfied at problem solving with arrays and lists, which are decent data structures that support item addition and lookup. However, as you have experienced from checking your mom's bottomless tote bag, the simple idea of going through 'tonnes' of items one-by-one fails blatantly as you will surely end with eye rashes and muscle strains. As we have learnt in previous chapters, the time complexity of checking an item in list takes O(n), which is far from efficiency. Moreover, there isn't a nicely-indexed 'list' of containers chained inside your mom's bag, so you cannot really retrieve her Maybelline lipstick by calling 'item 5'.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here comes your new proposal: hash tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, using hash tables would release you from the brute-force chore of item lookup. You may find helpful pulling out a piece of notebook paper, and record down each item's name acronym as your mom put it into the tote bag for the first time. Later on, as your mom ask for her 'lavendar-scented deoderant', you just convert the value 'lavendar-scented deoderant' into your self-designed hash function to get the correct hash key, say 'LVD_DEOD', and simply check if the key is recorded on your paper, all within a minute. A query search in hash table takes O(1), which is much better than O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, as you reflect on the hash table structure, you realize that you still need the whole tote bag by your side, which takes much space, and wonder if there exist more space-efficient algorithms. On the other hand, as you closely observed your dear mom's whirling item-search behavior, you found that she would not even use 70% of all the items in tote bag anyways once out on a picnic. So, instead of a 100% guarantee achieved by lists and hash table, offering her a probabilistic answer that 'the item of interest is most likely there' will suffice, chances are that you can get away with falsely reporing an item that is not in the bag as 7 out of 10 times you mom would not check. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there is a standard type of probabilistic data stucture called Bloom Filter (BF) which cousatisfactorily fulfill the core need of your mom's query.\n"

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### 2.2.1 Definition\n",
    "         A Bloom Filter (BF) is a space-saving, time-efficient data structure that supports fast query on if an item is in a set. To be precise, Bloom Filters is a probabilistic data structure that returns either a 'possibly inside' or an 'absolutely not inside' response. In other words, the Bloom Filter will produce some false positives (i.e. report item found when item does not exist in set) due to hash collisions, but zero false negatives (i.e. report item not found when item exists in set) as any detection of a zero bit in hashed slot would return the query with a false.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bloom Filter properties would be a good fit to solve your mom's worriness as: \n",
    "1. it is reasonable to bet on some small false positives in exchange of a more efficient search over repetitive requests from your mom, since she will likely not retrieve the item of interest immediately for use, and still reporting an 'item found' has an extra benefit of soothing her nerves;<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. it would have been a nightmare if false negatives are not prevented in the probabilistic setting : say you are not as attentive in item lookup and missed the item of interest while looping through all items or doing hash table checks, and report 'item not found' to your mom. Then your dear mother would initiate a blanket search through out the entire house to hunt down the 'item' for the next three hours, when in fact it is in her tote bag. You may then expect your family to reach the picnic site by sunset if not in moonlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best thing about BF is that, unlike lists and hash tables, it does not store any items at all: it is simply a ledger that registrates everything added to the set, so highly space-efficient. Therefore, you could implement a BF with just a piece of paper without caring about the actual items or their arrangements in the tote bag!\n",
    "\n",
    "So far so good. Let's check out how BF does the Jedi trick."

    "#### 2.2.2 Basic functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, BFs are implemented as a bit array, that is an indexed list of 0s and 1s. The total number of bits used in a BF, denoted by *m*, is called the length of BF. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like hash tables, BFs also use hash functions to convert an item value into a hash key, which is mapped onto a index in the BF bit array. On top of that, BFs seldomly use one hash function, but k hash functions to introduce information redundancy in recording an item's existance. \n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, given a 8-bit BF (*m* = 8), the same item 'hair comb' is hashed by first hash function H1 into index 3, by second hash funciton H2 into index 5, and by a third hash function H3 into index 6. Then the item 'hair comb' will be marked as existing in the set jointly by slot 3, 5, 6, in other words, slot 3,5 and 6 cocurrently witnessed 'hair comb's existance. Later, if anyone asserts 'hair comb's existance, this assertion can only be co-validated by all three slots.\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "    let's say we decide to use a 10-bit BF, with 3 independent hash functions. To implement the BF without your computer by hand is easy: you take out a piece of loose leaf paper and your hole punch from school bag, and draw some boxes to indicate bit array slots ( as a cs student, you have grown the good habit of 0 indexing). That's all you need.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<img src=\"paper_hole_punch.png\" width=\"400\" height='200'>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"BF_initialization.png\" width=\"400\" height='200'>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hole_initial.png\" width=\"400\" height='200'>\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "#### *2. Insertion*\n",
    "When an item is added, the item value is converted by all selected hash functions, each mapped onto an indexed position. Good hash functions will have a uniform distribution over its probability of hashing into each bit-array slot, and different hash functions should ideal return non-repetitive hash keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, let's say we want to add the item 'wallet' into the BF, and Hash_1(wallet) = 2,  Hash_2(wallet) = 8, Hash_3(wallet) = 5, then, we add 1 to each of the corresponding values in slot 2, 8, 5 of the BF array. \n",
    "<img src=\"BF_add_wallet.png\" width=\"400\" height='200'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, you simply punch a hole onto each of the red square 2, 8, and 5 on your paper margin:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hole_add_wallet.png\" width=\"500\" height='250'>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"BF_add_scarf.png\" width=\"400\" height='200'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notice** that the same slot 5 is registered twice by both added items, however BFs requires that any bit that has turned from 0 to 1 cannot reverse back to 0. Therefore subsequent hashing on a slot that is already filled by 1 is going to do nothing on the bit value.\n",
    "This one-directional rule also implies that a slot can only be zero if it is never being hashed into. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is easily understood by looking at your paper margin:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center; \">***As you punch slot 5  for the second time, a hole is still a hole!***</p>\n",

    "However, for all other slots that do not have a hole yet, it is obvious that no punch has been applied, implying that a slot can only be zero if it is never being hashed into.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *3. Lookup*\n",
    "Now, the BF is going to do its intended job of a fast check if an queried item exists in the set (or in your case, your mom's bottomless tote bag)\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, the algorithm first take in the queried item, collect all hash keys by passing through the requested item value into each of the hash functions, then check if any of the indices contain zeros. If a zero is found, we can conclude that the item is definitely NOT inside the set, for the same reasoning in addition (zeros represent un-hashed terretories). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"napkin_NotIn.png\" width=\"400\" height='200'>\n",
    "\n",
    "In your punch hole implementation, you simple check if any hashed slot does not have a hole in order to falsify an item's possible existance. For example, we can be 100% sure that 'napkin' is NOT inside mom's tote bag because slot 9 has not been punched a hole yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hole_napkin_NotIn.png\" width=\"500\" height='250'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if all hashed indices return 1s, it does not necessarily mean that the item is inside.Let's look at a pair of examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- first, a query on 'scarf' would return a true positive (that is, when all checked slots already have a hole on your paper margin):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"scarf_inside.png\" width=\"400\" height='200'>\n",
    "\n",
    "- but, it is possible that another new item, nail brush, which is hashed into 2,5 and 6, would 'fake' its positive existance by chance as the combination of hashed slots contain no zeros. This results in a case of false positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"nail_brush_falsep.png\" width=\"400\" height='200'>\n",
    "\n",
    "here, you are misled by the hole in slot 5 (which is punched by 'scarf' and 'wallet') into believing that 'nail brush', who shares a punch in slot 5 as well (due to hash collisions), is also inside the tote bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hole_nail_brush_falsep.png\" width=\"500\" height='250'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we have argued that reporing some false positives does not matter much as long as we can make our mama worry-free, as chances are that she will not retrieve those queried items immediately, if not forever. However, we would still want to lower the false positive rate, FPR, as far as we can. Imagine how upset mom would become when she found out that her nail brush is not in the bag at the picnic: *She would lost all her fun glittering her little toes in the California sunshine!*\n",

    "#### 2.3.1 Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "      Counting Bloom Filters (CBFs) are essentially an extended branch of standard Bloom Filters that supports item deletion. Rather than using a bit array, CBFs uses a count array of non-negative integers. Instead of setting a ceiling at 1 for every bit slot, CBFs use a 'counter' that increment by 1 each time the slot is hashed by a function for a new insertion. CBFs inherit most structures and properties of Bloom Filters and is as efficient as BFs both in time and space.\n",
    "      \n",
    "As you reflect on your punchline loophole, you reconceptualize the item registration process, and come up with an ingenious idea of 'match counting' instead of hole punching. The idea is very simple: Rather than making a permanent hole that is impossible to recover, why don't you fetch a bunch of idle match boxes from your dad's garage, empty the boxes and represent each hash as one match stick. Then, everytime a slot is hashed into, you add that match stick into the corresponding match box.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"five_match_sticks.png\" width=\"400\" height='200'>  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.2 Key functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *1. Initialization*\n",
    "Same as BF, start with only zeros. However, be minded that this array is no longer a bit array, but a count array. In your conext, you would empty ten match boxes (that each has a limited capacity of storing, say, 5 matches) and align them on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"match_initial.png\" width=\"560\" height='280'>  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *2. Insertion*\n",
    "CBFs improve on BFs mainly in the way that added items are recorded on the ledger: if the same slot is hashed in twice over a temporal sequence, then the count increments to 2 instead of being capped at 1 in BF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the same toy example as in BF: first insert 'wallet', second insert 'scarf'\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"BF_add_wallet.png\" width=\"400\" height='200'>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"CBF_add_scarf.png\" width=\"400\" height='200'>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notice* here slot 5 records a 2 instead of 1, corresponding to 2 matches inside match box 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"match_addition.png\" width=\"500\" height='250'>  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *3. Lookup*\n",
    "Due to the different recording rules, we now check if all hashed slots have values greater than zero (instead of just looking for 1s). In your match-box implementation, you simple check if all hashed match boxes still have matchsticks inside. If none of the boxes is empty, you may confidently report that the item is most likely inside the tote bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the lookup time (access time) only depends on number of checked match boxes, which in turn depends only on the number of hash functions, k, you use to convert a query into counter index, the time complexity remains O(k), regardless of total number of items stored.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *4. Deletion*\n",
    "Here is what makes CBF most superior than BF: since every single hash is recorded by an increment of 1 on the CBF, i.e. the sum of all slot values must equal $n*k$ where $n$ is the number of items added and $k$ the number of hash functions used. This imply that each registration is independent and removing an item would not affect counts/records of other added items' existence status. The idea of independence is easily understood in the match-box analogy: Taking out one match stick which 'belongs' to 'wallet' would never make other sticks of other categories in the same match box disappear.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"still_sticks.png\" width=\"400\" height='200'>\n",

    "We can verify by current example of removing wallet from a two-item CBF:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"CBF_deletion.png\" width=\"400\" height='200'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, slot five remains a positive count = 1, indicating that there exist another item that shares this hash slot with the item 'wallet'.\n",
    "In your match-box implementation of CBFs, you'd be pleased to find out that there is still a match left after removal:\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src=\"still_a_stick.png\" width=\"500\" height='250'>\n",

    "<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "- Blockchain data security over high-performance frequent transactions depends on its public consensus by all nodes in the smart contract (Zheng, 2017), and CBF is a handy tool to maintain a distributed ledgering system while allowing fast and accurate memebership identity verification. For example, Chen and his team (2018) presented their design of Certchain in which a DCBF-Dual CBF is used to eliminate false positives in public and efficient certificate audits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CBFs are frequently used in networking device algorithms in fields of accounting monitoring, load balancing, caching and policy enforcement, routing etc. Due to its fast membership check and simple implementation, it is widely used to check how many packets are queued,if a given state is reached or IP lookups (Fan et al., 2000; Ficara et al., 1977-1978)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applications in data management is ample in terms of malware detection, flagging and deletion. For example, Google Chrome implemented CBFs to flag malicious contents if an exact match between hashed values and a signature of safe contents. If no exact match, the content can be blocked and removed from the web (Erdogan & Cao, 2007). "

    "The access time for CBF is O(k) which is determined by the number of hash funcitons k. The more hash functions we use to store same number of items in a fixed array, it is more likely to get hash collisions, which then drives up false positive rates. So to reduce FPR, we should reduce number of hash functions used."

    "As we can see from the graph, the theoretical vs empirical FPRs highly agree with each other below certain threshold as the green scatters closely cluster around the red line of perfect agreement (slope = 1), (around 0.5).  This makes sense as CBFs is useful only if false positive rates remain as low as possible, if FPR is higher than 50%, a probabilistic lookup would not even beat a random guess. "

    "As Bonomi et al (2006) argued, CBFs does take up much memory spaces and only allows small counters, thus numerical overflow is quite likely once implemented to register tonnes of data from say a big bank or healthcare records. Also, CBFs becomes useless if we set p > 0.5 as the experimental FPRSs becomes 1. Additionally, false negatives are empirically not prevented by CBFs (Guo, 2010) "

My narration also targets common experiences in a student's life, which hopefully hooks reader attention right from beginning.\n",
